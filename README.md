# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This is a machine learning project that predicts credit risk in loan applicants. By employing supervised machine learning algorithms, we can resample, train, and test our model, and compare the performance of each of the algorithms in the accuracy of accurately predicting credit risk. 

The algorithms used for this project include RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, as well as ensemble classifiers including BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier.
