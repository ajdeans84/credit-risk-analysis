# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This is a machine learning project that predicts credit risk in loan applicants. By employing supervised machine learning algorithms, we can resample, train, and test our model, and compare it to the performance of SMOTEENN and ensemble classifiers in the accuracy of accurately predicting credit risk.
