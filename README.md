# Credit Risk Analysis

## Project Overview
This is a machine learning project that predicts credit risk in loan applicants. By employing supervised machine learning algorithms, we can resample, train, and test our model, and compare it to the performance of SMOTEENN and ensemble classifiers in the accuracy of accurately predicting credit risk. 

## Results
//Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.


## Summary
//Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
